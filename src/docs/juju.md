# Using Juju

*This page assumes you have installed MicroStack and that your OpenStack cloud
has been verified via the [Quickstart][quickstart] guide.*

Now that you have OpenStack running you can use it as a backing cloud with
[Juju][juju-homepage].

## Install Juju

Begin by installing Juju as a snap:

```bash
sudo snap install juju --classic
```

## Generate image metadata for Juju

Juju needs to know how to find metadata for the images necessary for
provisioning its machines. For private clouds such as OpenStack this must be
done manually via *Simplestreams*. 

First decide on a Ubuntu release. Here we'll use Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic) so
we start by importing a Bionic image into OpenStack:

```bash
OS_SERIES=bionic
IMAGE_ID=$(curl http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/$OS_SERIES/current/$OS_SERIES-server-cloudimg-amd64.img | \
microstack.openstack image create \
--public --container-format=bare --disk-format=qcow2 \
-f value -c id $OS_SERIES)
```

The image's ID will be stored in variable `IMAGE_ID`. You can also list
OpenStack images (and their IDs) in the usual way:

```bash
microstack.openstack image list
```

Next, generate the metadata:

```bash
mkdir ~/simplestreams
OS_REGION=microstack
KEYSTONE_IP=10.20.20.1
juju metadata generate-image -d ~/simplestreams -i $IMAGE_ID -s $OS_SERIES -r $OS_REGION -u http://$KEYSTONE_IP:5000/v3
```

See [Cloud image metadata][juju-cloud-image-metadata] in the Juju documentation
for extra information.

## Add the cloud to Juju

Create a cloud definition file, say `microstack.yaml`, for the OpenStack cloud
(notice the region of 'microstack'):

```yaml
clouds:
    microstack:
      type: openstack
      auth-types: [access-key,userpass]
      regions:
        microstack:
           endpoint: http://10.20.20.1:5000/v3
```

Now add the cloud by referencing that file:

```bash
juju add-cloud microstack -f microstack.yaml
```

The command `juju clouds --local` should now list the cloud.

## Add the cloud credentials to Juju

Source a file to have the shell pick up credential information:

```bash
source /var/snap/microstack/common/etc/microstack.rc
```

Now supply that information to Juju:

```bash
juju autoload-credentials
```

An interactive session will ensue where you will need to select the
OpenStack credentials that the command has located. Here is an example:

```no-highlight
Looking for cloud and credential information locally...

1. LXD credential "localhost" (new)
2. openstack region "<unspecified>" project "admin" user "admin" (new)
3.  (new)
Select a credential to save by number, or type Q to quit: 2

Select the cloud it belongs to, or type Q to quit [microstack]: ENTER

Saved openstack region "<unspecified>" project "admin" user "admin" to cloud microstack

1. LXD credential "localhost" (new)
2. openstack region "<unspecified>" project "admin" user "admin" (new)
3.  (new)
Select a credential to save by number, or type Q to quit: Q
```

Added credentials can be inspected with:

```bash
juju credentials --show-secrets --format yaml
```

## Create the Juju controller

Create the Juju controller:

```bash
juju bootstrap --bootstrap-series=$OS_SERIES --metadata-source=~/simplestreams \
--model-default network=test --model-default external-network=external \
--model-default use-floating-ip=true microstack msk
```
 
Refer to [Configuring controllers][juju-controller-config] for information on
the options used in the above command.

## Deploy a workload

We'll now run a workload on the OpenStack cloud. Here, we'll deploy a small
Kubernetes cluster via the `kubernetes-core` bundle within the empty 'default'
model:

```bash
juju deploy kubernetes-core
```

Once the output to `juju status` has settled run the demo Kubernetes "microbot"
application that came with the bundle:

```bash
juju run-action --wait kubernetes-worker/0 microbot replicas=2
```

To confirm that the application is running you can query the cluster with the
`kubectl` utility:

```bash
mkdir ~/.kube
juju scp kubernetes-master/0:config ~/.kube/config
sudo snap install kubectl --classic
```

Sample output:

```no-highlight
NAME                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
microbot-594cc9b87-77gjv   1/1     Running   0          7m44s
microbot-594cc9b87-nkrsk   1/1     Running   0          7m44s
```

To remove everything to do with Kubernetes run these commands:

```bash
juju destroy-model -y default
sudo snap remove kubectl
rm -rf ~/.kube
```
